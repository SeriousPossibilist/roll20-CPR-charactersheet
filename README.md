# Cyberpunk RED Character Sheet
A custom character sheet for Cyberpunk RED, built for use with Roll20. Admittedly, I am quite new to Cyberpunk RED
but I'm hoping as I pick up experience as a DM, I'll be more able to accurately pinpoint things I'll need to add
to the sheet.

## Current Features

- Based off the official [Cyberpunk RED Character Sheet by R. Talsorian Games](https://rtalsoriangames.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/RTG-CPR-CharacterSheet.pdf)
- Stores skill point investment, miscellenaous bonuses (cyberware, DM bonuses) and calculates total modifier (and handles skill rolls)
- Autocalculates health, button for deathrolls and places to keep track of base penalty and current death penalty
- Toggle character creation starting stat total/skill total (does NOT account for '4' free points in Cultural Language)
- Table for storing weapons + attack rolls that show ranged DVs for ranged attacks
- Damage rolls when you click the weapon name in the chat (multiplier for Autofire cannot be calculated at this time)
- Section for storing Lifepath & Inventory
- Section for storing Cyberware
- Section for storing programs, Black ICE, and hardware relevant to Netrunning

## Roadmap

- [ ] A section for storing details about vehicles
- [ ] Support for martial arts and other actions in combat
- [ ] Support for multiclassing
- [ ] Detecting the wound level of the player based off current health / max health and automatically applying the penalties to rolls
- [ ] More details/space for Critical Injuries & Addictions
